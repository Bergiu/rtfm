## Blocks
# Message Block
Can be written to with [royal]printflush[] [coral]Building[].
Cannot be read from.
Acts like a 5.0 message block otherwise.

# Switch
Toggles output when clicked.
Read with [royal]sensor[] on [coral]@enabled[].
Can be written to with [royal]control[] to act as a factorio-style pixel if you don't like displays.

# Micro Processor
This block runs the logic assembly code.
It has connection [coral]Building[]s which are in const variables [pink]<blocksuffix><index>[],
 this variable is shown when selecting the processor.
It can connect to any block in a $(Blocks.microProcessor.range / Vars.tilesize) tile radius.
With regards to instructions:
	- Holds $(LExecutor.maxInstructions) instructions max, with the code being at most $(Math.pow(2, 15) - 1) characters.
	- Runs $(Blocks.microProcessor.instructionsPerTick) instructions every tick.

# Logic Processor
Like a [royal]Micro Processor[], with some modifications:
	- Range is increased to $(Blocks.logicProcessor.range / Vars.tilesize) tiles.
	- $(Blocks.logicProcessor.instructionsPerTick) instructions are ran per tick, $(
		Blocks.logicProcessor.instructionsPerTick
		/ Blocks.microProcessor.instructionsPerTick)x faster.
	- 2x2 instead of a 1x1

# Hyper Processor
Above except:
	- Range is $(Blocks.hyperProcessor.range / Vars.tilesize) blocks
	- $(Blocks.hyperProcessor.instructionsPerTick) instructions per tick, $(
		Blocks.hyperProcessor.instructionsPerTick
		/ Blocks.microProcessor.instructionsPerTick)x faster than a micro processor.
	- Requires cryofluid to process instructions
	- 3x3 instead of 2x2
This outranges a ripple, use them as radars.

# Display
An 80x80 canvas that [royal]drawflush[] instructions render on.
It can handle polygons with up to 25 sides.
The framebuffer only needs to be drawn to once for static images.

# Large Display
Like the [royal]Display[] but 6x6 and with a 176x176 canvas size.
You cannot draw more detailed polygons with it.

# Memory Cell
Has 64 [coral]double[]s of memory.
Use the [royal]read[]/[royal]write[] instructions on it.
Memory can be shared between processors.

# Memory Bank
Like a [royal]Memory Cell[] but with 512 [coral]double[]s of memory.
It's 2x2, so it is twice as space-efficient.
