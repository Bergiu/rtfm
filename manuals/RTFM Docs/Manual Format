# Headings
Headings start with [coral]#[] and are [stat][[stat][] by default, with an underline.
Unlike markdown, heading size is proportional to number of [coral]#[]es, not inversely.
Heading text size is the square root of the heading depth.
########### big heading :D

# Centering
~Lines can be centered with a [coral]tilde (~)[] at the start.

# Images
You can add images with [coral]{texture[[:size]}[].
The size is the image's height by default, width is scaled with it.
[stat]Prefix your mod's textures with modname-, as always.[]
If you ever need to escape a set of {[red][]curly brackets}, add symbols that arent :-_ inside.
Example:
	{rtfm-image-example}

# Text
Unformatted text is simply added as labels to the page's table.
You can use colours as usual with [coral][[][].
Colours will bleed onto the next line, so [red]make sure
 to cap them off with [[][]

Pages read from files have tabs replaced with 4 spaces, to save on disk space.
